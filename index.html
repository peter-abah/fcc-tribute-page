                <h2>A brief timeline of Ken Saro-Wiwa's life</h2>
                <p class="tribute">Ken Saro-Wiwa was born on <time datetime="1941-10-10"> 10 October 1941 </time>
                    in Bori, Nigeria. He was a Nigerian writer, television producer and enviromental
                    activist. Saro-Wiwa was a member of the Ogoni people, an ethnic minority in
                    Nigeria whose homeland, Ogoniland, in the Niger Delta has been targeted for
                    crude oil extraction since the 1950s and which has suffered extreme environmental
                    damage from decades of indiscrimate waste dumping.</p>
                <hr>
                <p class="tribute">Initially as spokesperson, and then as president, of the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni
                    People (MOSOP), Saro-Wiwa led a nonviolent campaign against environmental degradation of the land
                    and waters of Ogoniland by the operations of the multinational petroleum industry, especially the
                    Royal Dutch Shell company.[2] He is also known as a critic of the Nigerian government, for its
                    allegedly reluctant behavior to enforce environmental regulations on the foreign petroleum companies
                    operating in the area.</p>
                <hr>
                <p class="tribute">At the peak of his non-violent campaign, he was tried by a special military tribunal for allegedly
                    masterminding the gruesome murder of Ogoni chiefs at a pro-government meeting, and hanged in 1995 by
                    the military dictatorship of General Sani Abacha. His execution provoked international outrage and
                    resulted in Nigeria's suspension from the Commonwealth of Nations for over three years</p>
